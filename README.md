# Project-3

## Wins
* Accomplished MVP goals of CRUD<br>
* Set up REACT using CRA (create-react-app)<br>
* Established separate backend and front-end servers<br>
* App hosted live on Heroku (see link above) <br>
* Admin authentication for inventory mgmt<br>

<p>Overall we were able to work well as a group because we made sure to stay in constant communication about what stage we were in, using tools like slack, github and trello as well as person to person.<p>

## Struggles
<p>We struggled with getting our app live on Heroku but in the end prevailed with help from the 'Heroku Whisperer'. We also had our fair share of struggles with github--pushing, pulling, and merge conflicts, but were able to work through those with help from Donovan.<p>
  
## Things we would like to accomplish in the future
* Adding a cart so customers could order online<br>
* User authentication so customers could have their own account w/ favorites<br>
* Make better use of User Stories in Trello.
